Why do you need If Else?

Suppose you want an algorithm that makes a choice. In that case, what we want the program to do is:


Something If a particular situation is true, and Else if itâ€™s false.

While Loop There is a True-False condition at the top. We only enter the block if the test is true, and do the whole block only if the test is true. The main difference between If-Else and While loop is that at the end of the block, we jump back and do the test again. There is no else to a while statement.

For Loop For loops are managed by a counting variable (often named as i, j, or similar)
